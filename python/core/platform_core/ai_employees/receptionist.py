"""Receptionist / WhatsApp manager — free-text customer messages the menu doesn't cover.

The router (MessagingService.route) tries STOP, "talk to a person" and the
structured journeys first; only a free-text message nobody matched reaches
here. Cost ladder (§8.4): deterministic intent first; the model only when that
fails, and then only to CLASSIFY (intent + which listed service). The model
never writes the reply: every answer is built from the business's own records
— opening hours, address, phone, catalogue prices — so it cannot invent a
price, an availability or a promise. A booking is started through the
WhatsApp booking journey, where the customer picks from the engine's real free
times. Anything it cannot answer from records becomes an enquiry (lead) and
goes to a person. Customer text is data: nothing here changes a price, a
permission or an AI setting.
