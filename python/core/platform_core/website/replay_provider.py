"""Recorded model answers for tests and acceptance runs (Capability Universe §27).

`AI_PROVIDER=replay` with `LOCAH_AI_REPLAY_FILE=<path>` serves structured
answers from a JSON file instead of a model: for the interview, keyed by the
owner's exact message; the website's creative plan by "creative:<business
name>"; a document read by "document:<sha256 of the file>". Nothing is ever
sent anywhere. A message with no
recording fails like an unreachable model, so the deterministic path takes
over — exactly what happens in production when the provider is down.

Never set in staging or production: it answers only what was recorded.
