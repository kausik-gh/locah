"""The Business OS module catalogue (Capability Universe §5, §6; Business OS Guide §4).

One entry per entitlement key. It says, in the owner's words, what a module
does, what it lets customers do, what it lets staff do, and which setup steps
must be true before any surface may present it as working (Guide §4: "A
module should never be presented to a business as working until its data,
API, permissions and real UI are complete").

Keys follow the Capability Universe except where the First Launch registry
already had the key (MD §1: "the registry key wins"): the MD's `queue` is the
registry's `queue-operations`, and the MD's `insights` is the registry's
`analytics`. `trade-network` (ChitBridge link) is distinct from the registry's
`b2b-network` (supplier discovery, P6).

`built` is the honesty switch: only modules whose data, API, permissions and
UI exist in this codebase are built. A module that is not built is never
enabled, never offered as working, and never shown on a website.
