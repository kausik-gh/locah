"""Does the website say what this business is? Checked before anything renders.

A florist with a "Programmes" menu, an industrial supplier inviting visitors
to "Book a class", a restaurant talking about procurement: each is a website
that looks finished and means the wrong thing. The composer is careful, and
the model's words are governed — this is the last deterministic check, over
the whole payload, of business semantics against:

* navigation labels,
* calls to action (hero, bar, closing band, ordering label),
* section titles,
* media (the truth rule: no drawn picture where a picture is evidence),
* treatment (a photographer's site must present work).

Each finding is FAIL (meaning is wrong: repaired, never shipped as is) or
FLAG (worth a human look; left as is). Repairs are deterministic and use the
trade's own words (the playbook's browse label and title) or a call to action
built from what customers actually do; a label with no honest replacement is
removed rather than guessed.
