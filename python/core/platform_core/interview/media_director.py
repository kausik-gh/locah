"""Which pictures a website needs, where each comes from, and drawing the gaps.

A site with no pictures reads as a form that was filled in, and most small
businesses start with none. The earlier LOCAH sites that owners wanted to
publish had a picture in every slot that carries the design — the hero, the
menu or catalogue, the story, the closing band — all from one visual world.

Media plan (decided BEFORE the design is chosen, so the design knows pictures
will exist):

1. the owner's own uploads, then pictures from their menu/catalogue,
2. pictures already on the business,
3. Gemini-drawn drafts — by default, unless the owner asked for a text-led
   site (``visual_consent == "none"``),
4. otherwise a designed typographic treatment.

The media truth policy (``interview.models.TruthClass``) decides what may be
drawn at all:

* **mood** — hero, story, closing band: the trade's atmosphere (a home
  kitchen, a gym floor, calm architecture). Drawn for every trade, never
  presented as this business's own premises or project.
* **representative** — what a kind of thing looks like: a category of cuts, a
  bowl of podi, a family of pumps. Drawn as a labelled draft until a real
  photo arrives.
* **factual** — must show THIS project, this work, this person: a developer's
  named project, a photographer's or an interior studio's work. Never drawn;
  the card is typographic until the owner's photo arrives.

Every draft is marked AI_GENERATED on the Blueprint, cached by slot key (a
rebuild never redraws), and loses to a real photo the moment one exists.
