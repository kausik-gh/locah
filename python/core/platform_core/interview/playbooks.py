"""Trade knowledge: how an expert in each kind of business would talk to its owner.

This is Locah's memory of many businesses (Capability Universe §21 sector
playbooks, §22 operating models), kept as data:

* the questions an experienced person in the trade would ask, in the trade's
  own words ("Do people choose the cut too — curry cut, boneless?");
* what visitors browse (cuts, dishes, treatments, projects, plans…) and what
  the website calls it;
* what matters on this kind of site: real work photos for a photographer, the
  story for a home kitchen, the RFQ path for an industrial supplier;
* what is never worth asking this trade (delivery for a clinic).

A playbook is a **prior**. It decides which question is worth asking and how
to phrase it; it never becomes a fact about the business. Only what the owner
says is kept as truth.
