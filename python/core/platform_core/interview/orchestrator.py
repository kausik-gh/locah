"""One conversation engine for chat and voice. No DB or HTTP dependencies.

Per owner message: ONE model call returns a TurnIntelligence. Locah then

1. reads the message in the light of the question it answers (the reader),
   which checks every extraction for its semantic type and is the whole of
   the understanding when the model cannot be reached;
2. merges what survived into the Blueprint;
3. judges coverage for THIS business and decides — the checkpoint when there
   is enough for a strong first version, the summary when the owner wants to
   build, otherwise the single most informative next question (planner).

Replies stay short enough to be spoken. Voice calls exactly this.
