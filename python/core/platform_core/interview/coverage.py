"""Coverage-driven readiness: is there enough for a strong first website?

The old rule was a checklist — every "essential" target answered, plus the
story, photos and logo asked once — and it grew with every keyword the owner
used. A meat shop that takes orders needed thirteen separate answers.

Here what Locah knows is judged dimension by dimension (identity, what is
offered, how customers buy, fulfilment, place, pricing, operations, brand,
story, media), and each missing piece is classified **for this business**:

* BLOCKING — without it there is no honest first website (what the business
  is, what it offers, what a customer should be able to do);
* HIGH_VALUE — changes the first website a lot (cuts and units for a meat
  shop, delivery or pickup, a photographer's real work, a gym's plans);
* ENRICHMENT — makes it better, can come after the first version (prices,
  hours, the story, photos for most trades);
* OPTIONAL — only if the owner wants to keep refining (logo, team, stock…).

Ready means every BLOCKING piece is resolved and HIGH_VALUE pieces are either
known, asked once, or the question budget for this kind of business is spent.
Once ready, always ready: saying more adds detail, never takes Build away.
