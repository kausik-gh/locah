"""Opt-in generated artwork. Never synthesize photos of actual staff/products.

Two things an owner may ask Locah to draw, and only when they ask:

  hero  wide editorial artwork for the top of the homepage — mood and
        material for the trade, never a picture of the business itself;
  logo  a one-letter monogram, for an owner who has no logo yet.

Both are stored as ordinary media assets marked AI_GENERATED, and both lose to
anything the owner uploads: a hero section that already has a picture keeps
it, and an uploaded logo is never replaced.
