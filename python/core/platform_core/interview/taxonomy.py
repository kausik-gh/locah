"""What a business sells, as a structure — not a comma list.

"We sell chicken, mutton, fish different varieties" used to become three
website cards, one of them titled "Fish different varieties". A merchandiser
reads the same sentence as: Chicken, Mutton and Fish are *groups*; the owner
keeps several kinds of fish without having named them yet; and whether people
choose cuts is still unknown. That reading decides what the site shows (a
category grid, a product grid, chips) and what is worth asking next ("which
fish do you usually keep?"), so it is kept here as first-class state.

The model proposes the grouping each turn; this module decides what is kept:

* item names must be built from the owner's own words;
* a group label may be Locah's ("Fish & Seafood") only when it groups items
  the owner named, and it is marked as a suggestion;
* phrases like "different varieties", "all kinds", "etc" are signals that a
  group has depth, never item names;
* prices and units are kept only when every number in them is the owner's.

Nothing here branches on a kind of business.
