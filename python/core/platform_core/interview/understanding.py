"""What Locah shows it has understood — typed, never a field dump.

The panel used to print strings: whatever landed in `customer_actions` was
split on commas into "What a customer does", so "GYm equipment, available
trainers, dumbells, contact section" appeared as four customer steps, and a
delivery area filed as opening hours read "Hours: All india".

Every value here has a type and is re-derived from the owner's own words
through the reader's checks:

* OFFERING — something sold or provided (from the structured range);
* CUSTOMER ACTION — something a customer does, canonical (order on WhatsApp,
  book a table, ask for a quote…);
* CONTENT — a part of the website the owner asked for ("contact section");
* OPERATING FACT — how buying works: units, delivery, pickup, payment;
* LOCATION — where the business is; SERVICE AREA — where it delivers or serves;
* HOURS — only an actual schedule;
* MODULE — a recommended tool.

A value that fails its type check is not shown. Nothing is split on commas.
