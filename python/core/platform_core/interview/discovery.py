"""Business discovery: what Locah still needs to understand, and what to ask next.

The old interview completed three fields and then asked for a location, a phone
number and a logo — for every business. "We sell all types of meat" filled
`offerings`, so Locah never asked which meats, how they are sold, or how they
reach the customer; and because `description` was still empty it asked "what
do people come to you for?" again. The questions were a fixed list.

Here the question space is a catalogue of *discovery targets* — concepts such
as "how products are sold" or "delivery or pickup" — each declaring which
kinds of business it matters for, in the vocabulary of Document 07 §11.1
(sells products, accepts orders, delivers, has a team...). Nothing branches on
a business type. A business's characteristics come from two places:

* what the owner actually said (operating patterns, answers) — strong;
* the Business-Type Profile of its likely type — a prior, weaker.

The planner ranks the targets that are relevant, not yet known and not already
asked, and hands the model a short list to phrase from. The model proposes one;
the planner accepts it only if it is still worth asking. Asking is tracked by
concept, so a reworded version of a known question is still a known question.
