"""Allocating bookable subjects — resources and providers — to a time interval.

This is the half of booking that can collide. Everything about which business
type is being served lives elsewhere; here there are only subjects, intervals
and two allocation modes.

Why exclusive and pooled are enforced differently
-------------------------------------------------
An exclusive subject is guarded by a Postgres exclusion constraint, so two
requests that both read availability before either commits cannot both win —
the loser's INSERT is rejected by the database rather than by whichever process
happened to look second.

A pooled subject cannot be guarded that way. "Seats sold across overlapping
allocations must not exceed capacity" is a sum, and an exclusion constraint
compares pairs. Those go through an advisory lock keyed on the resource plus a
sum inside the same transaction, which is correct but is a genuinely weaker
mechanism: it holds because every writer takes the same lock, not because the
database would refuse a bad row on its own.
