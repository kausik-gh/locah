"""Collect what is due, simply (Founder refinement — Payments; MD §6.1, §12.4).

Payments answers five questions for any transaction — an order, a booking, a
membership, a bill or a khata balance: how much is due, how much is being
collected now, how it is paid, whether it was actually confirmed, and what
remains. The transaction's own state never changes because a payment attempt
failed; retrying creates a new attempt on the same transaction, never a new
order.

A **payment request** is a secure link for an amount (full, advance, deposit,
balance or dues). The customer pays it by:

* **UPI to the business's own UPI ID** — LOCAH cannot see that money arrive, so
  the attempt stays "being confirmed" until the business confirms it arrived
  (or says it did not, and the customer can try again);
* **online through a payment provider** — only when the business has an active
  provider connection, and confirmed only by the provider's verified webhook
  (Cashfree direction; activation pending, so not offered today).

The browser is never payment truth. A webhook replay never pays twice; a
second payment for a link that was already paid is kept (the money moved) and
flagged for a refund.
