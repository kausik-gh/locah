"""Composing a website draft: adding, removing, reordering and duplicating sections.

Why this is a separate service
------------------------------
`WebsiteService.patch_section` can change what a section *says*. Nothing until
now could change what a page is *made of* — there was no way to add a section,
remove one, or move one. That is the floor the whole editing experience stands
on, and without it the Workspace could only ever be a form over a fixed layout
that generation happened to produce.

What governs it
---------------
Structure is not freehand. Every section is an instance of a platform-defined
SectionType, and this service will only ever create one of those: the id must
exist in `website_section_types`, the variant must be one the type declares, and
the content must validate against the type's own JSON schema. A prompt, a
mis-click or a bad AI response cannot introduce a section the renderer does not
know how to draw.

Capability, not decoration
--------------------------
`website_section_types.contributing_module` records which module actually feeds
a section its data. A Menu is fed by the offerings catalogue; an Enquiry form is
fed by Leads. Offering a business a section whose module is switched off would
put an empty shelf on their website and a control in Workspace that cannot
work — so `available_section_types` asks the module registry what is live and
returns only what this business can genuinely publish.

Existing sections are deliberately not policed the same way. A business that
turns Leads off should not have its enquiry form silently deleted; the renderer
already declines to draw what has no data behind it, and the owner keeps the
choice.

        # and CTA copy that refers to them.
