"""The switch that makes every paid AI call fail loudly, before it leaves the process.

`LOCAH_TEST_NO_EXTERNAL_AI=1` turns it on. With it on:

* every provider path — text (Gemini, xAI), images (Gemini, xAI) and voice
  credentials (Gemini Live, xAI realtime) — calls :func:`guard_external_ai`
  immediately before its network request, and the call raises
  :class:`ExternalAICallBlocked` instead of spending anything;
* :func:`install_transport_guard` additionally refuses any httpx request to a
  known AI host, so a path added later without its own guard is still caught;
* every refused attempt is recorded (:func:`blocked_calls`) and logged at ERROR.

Callers keep their existing deterministic fallbacks: an interview turn whose
model call is refused degrades exactly as it would with no key. That is why the
record exists — the test suite's autouse check fails any test that attempted a
paid call, so a missing stub can never pass quietly or spend credits.

Nothing here reads, logs or stores a key.
