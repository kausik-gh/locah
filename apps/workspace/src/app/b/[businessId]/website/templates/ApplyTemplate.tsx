/**
 * Choosing a template, with the consequence stated before it happens.
 *
 * Applying replaces the current draft — that is the honest meaning of "use this
 * one instead", and it is not something to discover afterwards. So the first
 * click asks, and only the second one does it. A business that has never
 * published has nothing to lose and is told so; one that has published is told
 * its live site is untouched until it publishes again, because that is the
 * thing they would actually worry about.
 *
 * A generated site names the template it was personalised from, and that is a
 * different situation again: the shape came from here, but every word in it was
 * written for this business. Re-applying the template would swap that back for
 * the plain starting copy, which is a loss worth spelling out — it is the one
 * case where choosing "the one you are already on" is destructive.
