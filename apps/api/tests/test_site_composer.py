"""The creative composer: one system, four very different websites.

No network. Blueprints are built the way the interview builds them (facts,
answers, the owner's catalogue); pictures come from a fake drawer. What is
checked is the design decision — archetype, reference profile, which sections
exist and in what shape — and the truth rules: no vague items, no generic
"What we do" for things people buy, chips only from the owner's answers, no
cart language anywhere in the content.
