"""After the website exists, talking to LOCAH changes it — against a real database.

Build a meat shop's first website through the ordinary interview (no model:
every turn takes the deterministic path), then edit it by talking:
"make it warmer", "don't show prices", "put delivery higher", "we also sell
prawns", "that isn't our story" (and the new story). Each edit must land in
the stored draft as structured change — theme, section content, order,
visibility — never as generated source.
