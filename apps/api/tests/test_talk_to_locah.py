"""Create Business by talking to LOCAH — one interview, however it starts.

Phase A: the owner can start by talking (no form, no category, no name), by
picking a category first, or by voice — and it is the same Blueprint, the
same planner and the same readiness either way. Nothing here calls a model:
the provider is either scripted or down.
