"""Website creative v4 — the owner path, against a real database.

Build through the ordinary interview; talk to LOCAH while personalization is
still pending; then run the real worker job with Gemini stubbed only at its
boundary (the creative plan, the image bytes, the storage upload). What must
hold:

* pictures are planned and drawn by default (no photos ≠ no pictures);
* the page is composed after the model chose its direction, so every picture
  is drawn in that direction's world;
* an owner change made during personalization is kept — never discarded as
  "superseded" — and untouched sections take the personalized version;
* an owner who asked for a text-led site gets no drawn pictures.
