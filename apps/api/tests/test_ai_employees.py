"""AI employee runtime (Capability Universe §8; ledger AI-13..AI-18, PM-14, PR-05).

One shared runtime, three real employees on it. What must hold — enforced by
the service, never by a prompt:

* tiers: T0 read, T1 draft, T2 act within limits, T3 owner approval always;
* a tool runs only if it belongs to the employee's kind and the owner left it on;
  the employee cannot give itself a tool, raise its tier or change its limits;
* kill switch per employee and a global pause; the module must be on;
* every decision is an ai_actions row;
* the receptionist answers only from records (never a made-up price), starts
  bookings through the booking journey, and hands the rest to a person;
* collections reminds overdue bills with their own link, not twice inside the
  owner's gap, and stops once paid;
* procurement drafts requisitions; a purchase order goes to a supplier only
  after the owner approves.

WhatsApp runs on the sandbox number (no Meta calls); the model is off in tests,
so the receptionist is on its deterministic path.
